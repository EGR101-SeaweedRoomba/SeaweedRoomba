~~ Roomba Positioning Program ~~

This is a program designed to run on a raspberry pi computer, onboard a seafloor seaweed roomba. 
With the raspberry pi connected to two rotary encoders, this system will allow a user to view the pi's path on the sea floor in a web browser.

Setup instructions:

- Install a headless Raspbian image onto any Raspberry Pi
- Connected to the raspberry pi, install necessary python libraries listed at the beginning of WebPage/server.py:
  import json
  import threading
  import time
  import random
  import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
  import math
  import flask
  import board
  import busio
  import adafruit_bno055
 
 - Set SeaweedRoomba/WebPage/server.py to run every time the roomba is restarted (e.g. by adding "python SeaweedRoomba/WebPage/server.py" to /etc/rc.local)
 - Connect rotary encoders to the raspberry pi, using ports 27 and 4, and 26 and 6. 
 - Connect rotary encoders to the wheels, noting the gear ratio. 
  - I believe that msot optical square-wave style rotary encoders will work for this. example: https://www.amazon.com/Incremental-Optical-Rotary-Encoder-Collector/dp/B07SKJ1WXB
 - Enter the wheel radius + gear ratio into server.py.

 NOTES
--------

server-w-imu integrates an inertial measurement (incl. accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) but has a tendency to accumulate error more than server.py.
